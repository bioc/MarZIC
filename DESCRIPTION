Version: 0.99.1
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Quran",
           family = "Wu",
           role = c("aut"),
           email = "wuquran@ufl.edu"),
           person(given = "Zhigang",

Description: This package provides a way to calculate marginal mediation effects with microbiome data as mediators. The mediator should be compositional data or count data which will be rescaled later on, and could be zero-inflated. The marginal mediation effect will be calculated for each taxon separately.
