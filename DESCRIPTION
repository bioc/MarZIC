Version: 0.99.2
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Quran",
           family = "Wu",
           role = c("aut"),

Description: This package provides a way to estimate and test marginal mediation effects for 
             zero-inflated compositional mediators. Estimates of Natural Indirect Effect (NIE),
             Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of each taxon, as well as their standand errors and 
             confident intervals, were provided as outputs. Zeros will not be imputed during 
             analysis.
